My interest in financial markets, technology and mathematics led me to develop a FIX Engine in Rust that interacts with brokerage servers to consume precise, real-time FX price data. This data was then coupled with co-integration and regression models to form a systematic investment system that executed orders in real-time or performed backtesting on large datasets taking into account trading costs.
